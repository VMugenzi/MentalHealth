    <h1>Good time with friend</h1>
    <p  class="textreadmore"> True friends always support each other even during the hardest of times.A true friend is one who feels happy for our success, on the other hand, who feel gloomy for our failures.<br> True friends are also known as bosom friends and they are the ones you can leave the whole world for! And they do so for you as well. Even if you have not talked to them for months and years, the moment you come across one another, it seems as if it was only yesterday when you people had last met. It is a completely different feeling altogether. There is no one sort of description that you can give to explain such a bond. True friends are always together in spirit. Those are the people who give you a single call and hearing them in stress, you simply leave everything that you were engaged in, jump out of the bed and take a breathe only after you reach up to them. Such friends are the ones who add an extra breath to your life and once you have people like them in your life, you are sure to cherish them forever. When you all are together, it is not just a voice that speaks but the unity among all is self-revealing. It is more than a family to you – may be greater than the family that you were born to! It is certainly a very rare and special gift to have such people in one’s life and the moment you know you have them, give no chance to lose them at any cost.</p>
